          - Research and development on state of the art algorithms for data fusion:
            - Most of the algorithms considered are used in an autonomous driving context.
            - Examples of algorithms:
              - Classical Data Fusion: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, etc.
              - AI Aided Kalman FIlters: KalmanNet, DANSE, APBM, etc.
              - AI Data Fusion: Camera+Radar, Camera+Lidar"
