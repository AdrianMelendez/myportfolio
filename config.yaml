    content: |-
      I hold two Bachelor's degrees — one in Physics and one in Electronic Engineering — followed by a Master's in Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, with a focus on planet formation through data analysis.

      After completing my studies, I decided to pursue an industry career rather than a PhD. I am currently working as an AI / Perception Engineer at [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/en-es), a defense and aerospace company, where I research and develop state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-sensor fusion, particularly for camera and radar systems. My work focuses on object detection, multi-object tracking, and real-time, high-performance perception pipelines.

      I enjoy tackling complex, open-ended problems and bridging the gap between research and production, from algorithm design to scalable system deployment.

      **Technologies I work with regularly:**
      - Docker, Kubernetes
      - PyTorch, SciKit-Learn
      - Pandas, Polars
      - Jenkins, GitLab CI
      - Stone Soup
      - Ultralytics YOLO
