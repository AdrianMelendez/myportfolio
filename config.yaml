      I have two Bachelor's degrees, one in Physics and one in Electronic Engineering. After these, I did a Master's Degree on Theoreitcal Physics
      and Astrophysics.

      I am currently working as an AI researcher at GMV, a defence and aerospace company. My role is to analyse the state of the art and develop
      algorithms for sensor data fusion.

          - Research and development on state of the art algorithms for data fusion:
            - Most of the algorithms considered are used in an autonomous driving context.
            - Examples of algorithms:
              - Classical Data Fusion: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, etc.
              - AI Aided Kalman FIlters: KalmanNet, DANSE, APBM, etc.
              - AI Data Fusion: Camera+Radar, Camera+Lidar"
