      First, during my education I did two Bachelor's degrees, one in Physics and one in Electronic Engineering. After these, I did a Master's Degree on Theoreitcal Physics
      and Astrophysics. specializing in the search of planet formation through data analysis.

      However, I decided not to pursue a PhD and start a company job instead. Currently, I am working as an AI researcher at GMV, a defence and aerospace company. My role is to analyse the state of the art and develop
      algorithms for sensor data fusion, specially camera and radar. The main tasks are object detection and multi-object tracking.

          - Research and development on state of the art algorithms for data fusion:
            - Most of the algorithms considered are used in an autonomous driving context.
            - Examples of algorithms:
              - Classical Data Fusion: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, etc.
              - AI Aided Kalman FIlters: KalmanNet, DANSE, APBM, etc.
